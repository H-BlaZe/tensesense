# Tense Identifier

## Description

This repository contains a Python codebase designed to identify the tense of a given sentence. The code is capable of detecting various verb tenses, including simple tenses (Present, Past, Future), continuous tenses (Present Continuous, Past Continuous, Future Continuous), and perfect tenses (Present Perfect, Past Perfect, Future Perfect). It handles different verb conjugations and employs specific keyword and pattern recognition to determine the tense of the input sentence.

## Features

- Identification of various verb tenses.
- Handling of different verb conjugations.
- Basic preprocessing of input sentences.
- Output display of identified tense(s) to the console.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code.

3. Run the script using Python.

   ```bash
   python tensesense.py
   ```

4. Enter your sentence when prompted.

5. The script will analyze the sentence and display the identified tense(s).

## Note

- This implementation covers basic tense detection and might not encompass all possible verb tenses and sentence structures.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more complex tense detection logic to handle irregular verbs and advanced sentence structures.
- Improve error handling for a better user experience.
- Integrate the code into a user-friendly interface, such as a web application.
